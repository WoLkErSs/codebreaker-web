    "Welcome to Codebreaker!<br>
    Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to
    break a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.<br>
    For each attempt you'll receive a message to realize which numbers in your
    guess are correct and which aren't.<br>
    A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same
    as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.<br>
    A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same
    as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.<br>
    Use hint command to see a random character of secret code."
